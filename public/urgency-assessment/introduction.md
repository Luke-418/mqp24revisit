# Introduction

Welcome to the Graphical Urgency Assessment Study!

In todayâ€™s fast-paced healthcare environment, the way we present and interpret test results can significantly influence clinical decisions and patient outcomes. Understanding the urgency of test results is crucial for prioritizing patient care and resource allocation. This study aims to explore how different visual representations of test results affect healthcare professionals' and laypeople's perception of urgency.

Through a series of image-based questions, you will be asked to assess the urgency of various test results. Your responses will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different graphical representations in conveying critical information quickly and accurately.
