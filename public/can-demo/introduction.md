# Introduction

This study delves into the realm of color association and its influence on human behavior, specifically focusing on how individuals relate different colors to specific actions. By employing a series of color bins as a tangible representation, we seek to determine the impact of color on decision-making processes, particularly in scenarios requiring the selection of an option based on color cues alone.

Our objective is to uncover whether certain colors instinctively prompt individuals towards specific behaviors or choices, without the influence of textual or symbolic guidance. This approach allows us to explore the inherent associations and psychological effects that colors may have.
